Welcome to the Trading Bots & HFT Arbitrage Collection, a repository of algorithmic trading bots developed in Python. This repository is organized into two main directories:

HFT-Arbitrage: Contains the most recent high-frequency trading and arbitrage strategies optimized for low-latency order execution across multiple exchanges.
Trading-Algorithms: Contains earlier trading bot implementations and backtesting tools for various strategies such as trend-following, scalping, and hybrid approaches.
🚀 About the Project
This project provides a comprehensive set of trading bot implementations. The latest innovations reside in the HFT-Arbitrage folder, where you’ll find state-of-the-art HFT code that leverages asynchronous programming, advanced logging, and real-time market data processing. The Trading-Algorithms folder houses proven trading strategies along with analytical and backtesting scripts.

🛠 Features
✔️ High-Frequency Trading & Arbitrage – Ultra-low latency order execution using async I/O
✔️ Real-Time Market Data – Processes live data from Binance and Bybit
✔️ Multiple Trading Strategies – Includes HFT arbitrage, trend-following, scalping, and hybrid methods
✔️ Robust Logging & Error Handling – Detailed logging for monitoring and troubleshooting
✔️ Backtesting & Analysis Tools – Scripts and notebooks for historical performance evaluation
